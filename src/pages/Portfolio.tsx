    text: `The Future Launch project was my first major engagement at Trew Knowledge. It centered on migrating the client’s legacy site to WordPress and developing a reusable library of custom, dynamic React components for their network of sites. My primary responsibilities included rebuilding existing components with enhanced data capabilities and creating new ones as fully customizable Gutenberg blocks, enabling drag-and-drop flexibility for content authors. These components empowered consistent layouts, improved analytics and tracking options, and streamlined visual customization across the platform. I also contributed to the creation of custom post types, templates, and patterns to further simplify and accelerate content production workflows.`,

    text: `The Mitchell’s Foods website was a full rebrand initiative where I was responsible for quality control and front-end styling refinement. I reviewed component implementation across the site to ensure consistency and usability, and updated visual styles to align with the new brand direction. This included fine-tuning layouts, resolving UI inconsistencies, and collaborating closely with design to maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the rebuild.`,

  Lightlife: {

    href: "https://lightlife.com/tempehfy/",
    text: `Lightlife is a website I actively maintain and enhance based on client needs. When the brand introduced its Tempeh launch initiative, I collaborated with the design team to build a new suite of components for the Tempehfy campaign page. Because the site was originally developed using an older full-site editing system, we implemented compatibility solutions to support modern Gutenberg-based components. The Tempehfy page was released in two separate phases, each featuring a unique design direction. Despite tight deadlines and evolving requirements, we successfully delivered both launches on schedule. My key contributions included the development of the new React components, configuring pages and templates, coordinating closely with design and technical leads to align on the vision, planning rollout efforts, and mentoring a newer developer who joined the project.`,

  "Grab 'N Snack": {
    image: grabnsnackBanner,
    href: "https://www.grabnsnack.ca/",
    text: `Similar to the Mitchell’s Foods project, Grab ’N Snack was a full-site rebrand focused on modernizing the visual identity. While only a few new components were introduced, the core of the work involved global styling updates, layout refinements, and re-styling inherited components from the parent theme to ensure consistency with the refreshed brand direction. This included improving responsiveness, aligning typography and color usage, and resolving UI inconsistencies across templates and page types.`,
    text2: ``,
  },
  "Thought Leadership": {
    image: thoughtBanner,
    href: "https://www.rbc.com/en/thought-leadership/",
    text: `Following the success of the initial RBC migration project, I was given the opportunity to help bring an additional two legacy sites, Thought Leadership and Climate Action Institute, into the WordPress ecosystem. With only the existing legacy sites and new design files as reference, our team worked closely with the client to define how each component should behave, providing recommendations on editing workflows, reusability, and scalability within Gutenberg.`,
    text2: `My role focused on rebuilding existing components with enhanced dynamic functionality to give content authors more flexibility, as well as developing new React-based blocks aligned to the updated design system. I also created key pages, custom templates, navigation menus, and reusable patterns to accurately reflect the original site structure while enabling a vastly improved publishing experience.`,
